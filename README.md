# comments-from-Google-Challenge
This is a site where the recipients of <a href="https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships">Google Developer Challenge Scholarship</a> 2017/2018 could post their comments about the first Phase of the course.

I made it as my thank you to Google and Udacity for the opportunity we've been given. And also to have something to remember this course and community by and show how many people from different countries were affected by it.

I'm planning to add another page with memorable projects that were made by the students in this Challenge.
